description: "Col·lectivaT is very proud to continue fulfilling one of its missions: to connect the two shores of the Mediterranean by facilitating access to culture and critical thinking. Therefore, thanks to the initiative and edition of <a href='https://descontrol.cat/'><b>Descontrol Editorial</b></a>, two of our partners <b>Özgür Güneş</b> and <b>Pelin Doğan</b> translated from Turkish into Spanish the book <a href='https://descontrol.cat/2019/05/08/prologo-arrestados/'><i>Arrestados: Notas de un periodista en una prisión turca</i></a> (Arrested: Notes of a journalist in a Turkish prison, in English; 'Tutuklandık', original title in Turkish) of Can Dündar, a Turkish journalist exiled in Germany since 2016. <p><i>Arrestados</i> is the testimony of a journalist persecuted and jailed by the "Justice pf the Palace" built by Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. Can Dündar, editor-in-chief of <i>Cumhuriyet</> newspaper, and Erdem Gül, the editor-in-chief of the same newspaper in Ankara, were arrested on November 26, 2015 for publishing "information that should remain secret" about transport of weapons from Turkey to Syria in trucks of the National Intelligence Organization of Turkey (MIT). Dündar's work is the testimony of a very convulsive period in the country, written during a 92-day preventative prison, which also opens the doors of the "dark" history of Turkey to Spanish-speaking readers."
